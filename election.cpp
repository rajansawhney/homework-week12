I. Winner of the election

Write a C program that allows the user to enter the last names of five candidates
in a local election and the number of votes received by each candidate.
The program should then output each candidateâ€™s name, the number of votes received,
and the percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. Your program should also output the winner of the election.

Example:
enter candidates last name, there are five candidates
enter candidate 0 last name
Peter
enter no of votes received by candidate 0
30
enter candidate 1 last name
Roy
enter no of votes received by candidate 1
20
enter candidate 2 last name
Ali
enter no of votes received by candidate 2
40
enter candidate 3 last name
Hales
